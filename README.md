This is a web application built by me, both frontend and backend, where u can perform all the basic things.

For executing----{
1. In git bash terminal, install all npm packages by passing the command "npm i" or "npm install".
2. Then use nodemon for hosting the server "nodemon index.js".
3. The server will be hosted in port 3000, go in any browser and write in url "localhost:3000".
4. There you go! the website would be working fine.
